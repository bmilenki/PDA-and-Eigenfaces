File Location:
An unzipped version of yalefaces folder should be in the same directory as the python script. That is the folder that carries everything, not the actual files themselves.
The video for part 3 will be saved in the same directory as the python script, in avi format.

Running the Code:
Each question has its own function that is runnable from the main() function. The default will be to run all 3 questions, and you can comment out the ones you dont want to run. 
Question 2 MUST be ran if Question 3 is also desired to run as Q3 takes input from the output of Q2.

Dependencies
numpy
scipy - used to standardize in Q1 (done manually in Q2)
matplotlib
os - for reading the file names from the directory
opencv-python (cv2) - video creation
pillow (PIL) - image manipulation
